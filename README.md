# Debian DKMS package for ntsync kernel module

The [ntsync](https://lore.kernel.org/all/20241213193511.457338-1-zfigura@codeweavers.com/) driver implementing NT synchronization primitives was merged for Linux 6.14.
This repository contains the source of a Debian package that uses DKMS to automatically build and install the ntsync kernel modules on Debian Bookworm (Linux 6.1) and Trixie/Sid (Linux 6.12).
Although untested, it should also work on Debian derivates like Ubuntu.

Current ntsync version is [6.14-rc1](https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/drivers/misc/ntsync.c?h=v6.14-rc1)
from [mainline](https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/drivers/misc/ntsync.c).
Additionally, it includes [fa2e558](https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/drivers/misc/ntsync.c?id=fa2e55811ae25020a5e9b23a8932e67e6d6261a4)
from [linux-next](https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/drivers/misc/ntsync.c)
that sets the `/dev/ntsync` mode to 0666 to facilitate access from user accounts.

Build and install the .deb package as follows:

```sh
sudo dpkg-deb -b ntsync-dkms.deb.d ntsync-dkms_6.14-rc1+fa2e558_all.deb
sudo apt install ./ntsync-dkms_6.14-rc1+fa2e558_all.deb
```
